## Dataset
The image dataset for this project is comprised of XX images from 37 locations on the first floor of Stata. See [here](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/README.md) for a map of our data collection locations. We built the dataset by taking a 8-10 second video at each location. In each video, we slowly turn to cover all 360 degrees of the location, while panning upwards and downwards to vary the angle. Finally, we extracted all frames from the videos.

This dataset is currently private, but may be published to this repository at a later date. At this moment, the dataset can be made available upon request.
